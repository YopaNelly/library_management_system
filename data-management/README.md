Case Study: Library Management System
Stage 1: Data Management

Create a list of books:

Initialize an empty list called books to store book information. Each book can be represented as a dictionary with keys such as title, author, genre, ISBN, etc.
Implement functions to add, update, and delete books:

add_book(): Prompt the user to enter the book details (title, author, genre, ISBN, etc.), create a dictionary with the entered information, and add it to the books list.
update_book(): Prompt the user to enter the book title to be updated, search for the book in the books list, and allow the user to modify its details.
delete_book(): Prompt the user to enter the book title to be deleted, search for the book in the books list, and remove it from the list.
Stage 2: Book Search and Display

Search for books:

search_books(): Prompt the user to enter a search keyword (title, author, genre, ISBN, etc.) and iterate through the books list to find matching books. Display the search results to the user.
Display book information:

display_books(): Take a list of books as input and iterate through it to display the book details (title, author, genre, ISBN, etc.) in a readable format. Provide options for the user to view all books or filter books by specific criteria (e.g., genre).
Stage 3: User Interface

Create a menu-driven interface:

Display a menu with options for the user to choose from, such as adding a book, searching for a book, displaying all books, or exiting the application.
Handle user input:

Prompt the user to select an option from the menu.
Based on the user's choice, call the corresponding functions (e.g., add_book(), search_books(), display_books()) to perform the desired actions.
Keep the application running until the user chooses to exit.
Stage 4: File Handling

Store book data in a file:
Implement functions to save the book information from the books list to a file in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV).
Implement functions to load the book data from the file and populate the books list with the retrieved information.
Stage 5: Additional Functionality

Book borrowing and returning:

Implement functions to handle the borrowing and returning of books, including checking the availability of a book, updating its status, and recording borrower information.
Generate book reports:

Implement functions to generate reports summarizing the book information, such as the total number of books, the number of books in each genre, and any additional details. Print or save the reports to a file.
User management:

Implement functions to manage user accounts, such as creating new accounts, updating user information, and handling user authentication. This can include features like user registration, login, and password reset.
